RISC OS free Beeps
------------------

This is a collection of sound samples from the operating system RISC OS,
originally produced by Acorn Computers.

It contains the desktop "beeps" that you can set the error/warning sound 
too.

Under RISC OS these sounds are generated programmatically using the synthesizer
modules WaveSynth, Percussion, and StringLib. No attempt to similarly generate 
them was done, instead the the audio was captured from RISC OS digitally and
sound samples saved from that.

I make no claim as to how good they are. Personally I think some of them are
pretty horrible!

Sound conversion description (feel free to ignore)
--------------------------------------------------

Sound of all beeps was captured from RPCEmu using OBS into a wav file.
This wav file was then split into individual samples using Audacity.
